# WrapperDE-FS
Ph.D. code about wrapper differential evolution for feature selection

Steps for the algorithm -->
1 - First of all, execute the "configuration" file for the dataset that you want by running the teste.sh script (it will run all the feature ranking algorithms available)
2 - Second, we need to move the files generated by the first step or change the script from weighted-tsne with the path for those files.
3 - After second step, you can run the weighted-tsne
4 - Should move files back in the main folder (wrapperDE-FS) and run the algorithm
